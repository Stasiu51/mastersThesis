Our protocol uses continuous measurements and Hamiltonian operations, which are weaker control tools than are typically assumed for quantum error correction. We develop a cost function appropriate for unknown quantum states and use it to optimize our state-estimate feedback. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we study our protocol for the three-qubit bit-flip code in detail and demonstrate that it can improve the fidelity of quantum states beyond what is achievable using quantum error correction when the time between quantum error-correction cycles is limited. © 2002 The American Physical Society.},

   abstract = {The promise of quantum computers is that certain computational tasks might be executed exponentially faster on a quantum processor than on a classical processor1. A fundamental challenge is to build a high-fidelity processor capable of running quantum algorithms in an exponentially large computational space. Here we report the use of a processor with programmable superconducting qubits2–7 to create quantum states on 53 qubits, corresponding to a computational state-space of dimension 253 (about 1016). Measurements from repeated experiments sample the resulting probability distribution, which we verify using classical simulations. Our Sycamore processor takes about 200 seconds to sample one instance of a quantum circuit a million times—our benchmarks currently indicate that the equivalent task for a state-of-the-art classical supercomputer would take approximately 10,000 years. This dramatic increase in speed compared to all known classical algorithms is an experimental realization of quantum supremacy8–14 for this specific computational task, heralding a much-anticipated computing paradigm. Quantum supremacy is demonstrated using a programmable superconducting processor known as Sycamore, taking approximately 200 seconds to sample one instance of a quantum circuit a million times, which would take a state-of-the-art supercomputer around ten thousand years to compute.},

We give a self-contained summary of the SW method with a focus on rigorous results. We begin with an exact definition of the SW transformation in terms of the so-called direct rotation between linear subspaces. From this we obtain elementary proofs of several important properties of H_\{eff\} such as the linked cluster theorem. We then study the perturbative version of the SW transformation obtained from a Taylor series representation of the direct rotation. Our perturbative approach provides a systematic diagram technique for computing high-order corrections to H_\{eff\}. We then specialize the SW method to quantum spin lattices with short-range interactions. We establish unitary equivalence between effective low-energy Hamiltonians obtained using two different versions of the SW method studied in the literature. Finally, we derive an upper bound on the precision up to which the ground state energy of the n-th order effective Hamiltonian approximates the exact ground state energy.},

basic properties of nature and functions as an excellent qubit, as it provides
a natural two-level system that is insensitive to electric fields, leading to
long quantum coherence times. We review the physics of semiconductor spin
qubits, focusing not only on the early achievements of spin initialization,
control, and readout in GaAs quantum dots, but also on recent advances in Si
and Ge spin qubits, including improved charge control and readout, coupling to
other quantum degrees of freedom, and scaling to larger system sizes. We begin
by introducing the four major types of spin qubits: single spin qubits, donor
spin qubits, singlet-triplet spin qubits, and exchange-only spin qubits. We
then review the mesoscopic physics of quantum dots, including single-electron
charging, valleys, and spin-orbit coupling. We next give a comprehensive
overview of the physics of exchange interactions, a crucial resource for
single- and two-qubit control in spin qubits. The bulk of this review is
centered on the presentation of results from each major spin qubit type, the
present limits of fidelity, and a brief overview of alternative spin qubit
platforms. We then give a physical description of the impact of noise on
semiconductor spin qubits, aided in large part by an introduction to the filter
function formalism. Lastly, we review recent efforts to hybridize spin qubits
with superconducting systems, including charge-photon coupling, spin-photon
coupling, and long-range cavity-mediated spin-spin interactions. Cavity-based
readout approaches are also discussed. This review is intended to give an
appreciation for the future prospects of semiconductor spin qubits, while
highlighting the key advances in mesoscopic physics over the past two decades
that underlie the operation of modern quantum-dot and donor spin qubits.},

Previous feedback designs could feature spurious equilibria, or resort to discrete kicks pushing the system away from these equilibria to ensure global asymptotic stability. We present a new approach that consists of introducing controls driven by Brownian motions. Unlike the previous methods, the resulting closed-loop dynamics can be shown to stabilize the target manifold exponentially. We further present a reduced-order filter formulation with classical probabilities. The exponential property is important to quantify the protection induced by the closed-loop error-correction dynamics against disturbances.

In open loop, such system converges stochastically to one of the eigenstates of the measurement operator. Previous work has proposed state feedback that destabilizes the undesired eigenstates and relies on a probabilistic analysis to prove convergence. In contrast, we here associate the state observer to an adaptive version of so-called Markovian feedback (essentially, proportional control) and we show that this leads to a global exponential convergence property with a strict Lyapunov function. Furthermore, besides the instantaneous measurement output, our controller only depends on the single coordinate along the measurement axis, which opens the way to replacing the full state observer by lower-complexity filters in the future.},

   abstract = {Reliable quantum information processing in the face of errors is a major fundamental and technological challenge. Quantum error correction protects quantum states by encoding a logical quantum bit (qubit) in multiple physical qubits. To be compatible with universal fault-tolerant computations, it is essential that states remain encoded at all times and that errors are actively corrected. Here we demonstrate such active error correction on a continuously protected logical qubit using a diamond quantum processor. We encode the logical qubit in three long-lived nuclear spins, repeatedly detect phase errors by non-destructive measurements, and apply corrections by real-time feedback. The actively error-corrected qubit is robust against errors and encoded quantum superposition states are preserved beyond the natural dephasing time of the best physical qubit in the encoding. These results establish a powerful platform to investigate error correction under different types of noise and mark an important step towards fault-tolerant quantum information processing. Large-scale quantum information processing requires the continuous protection of quantum states against errors. Here, the authors demonstrate active quantum error correction that improves the dephasing time of quantum states using a diamond quantum processor.},

   abstract = {Spin is a fundamental property of all elementary particles. Classically it can be viewed as a tiny magnetic moment, but a measurement of an electron spin along the direction of an external magnetic field can have only two outcomes: parallel or anti-parallel to the field. This discreteness reflects the quantum mechanical nature of spin. Ensembles of many spins have found diverse applications ranging from magnetic resonance imaging to magneto-electronic devices, while individual spins are considered as carriers for quantum information. Read-out of single spin states has been achieved using optical techniques, and is within reach of magnetic resonance force microscopy. However, electrical read-out of single spins has so far remained elusive. Here we demonstrate electrical single-shot measurement of the state of an individual electron spin in a semiconductor quantum dot. We use spin-to-charge conversion of a single electron confined in the dot, and detect the single-electron charge using a quantum point contact; the spin measurement visibility is ∼65. Furthermore, we observe very long single-spin energy relaxation times (up to ∼0.85 ms at a magnetic field of 8 T), which are encouraging for the use of electron spins as carriers of quantum information.},

Here we advantageously use interface-SO coupling for a critical control axis in a double-quantum-dot singlet-triplet qubit. The magnetic fieldorientation dependence of the g-factors is consistent with Rashba and Dresselhaus interface-SO contributions. The resulting all-electrical, two-Axis control is also used to probe the MOS interface noise. The measured inhomogeneous dephasing time, T2m, of 1.6 ?s is consistent with 99.95 28Si enrichment. Furthermore, when tuned to be sensitive to exchange fluctuations, a quasi-static charge noise detuning variance of 2 μeV is observed, competitive with low-noise reports in other semiconductor qubits.

A powerful method to suppress these effects is quantum error correction. Typically, quantum error correction is executed in discrete rounds, using entangling gates and projective measurement on ancillary qubits to complete each round of error correction. Here we use direct parity measurements to implement a continuous quantum bit-flip correction code in a resource-efficient manner, eliminating entangling gates, ancillary qubits, and their associated errors. An FPGA controller actively corrects errors as they are detected, achieving an average bit-flip detection efficiency of up to 91. Furthermore, the protocol increases the relaxation time of the protected logical qubit by a factor of 2.7 over the relaxation times of the bare comprising qubits. Our results showcase resource-efficient stabilizer measurements in a multi-qubit architecture and demonstrate how continuous error correction codes can address challenges in realizing a fault-tolerant system. Continuous quantum error correction requires less ancillary resources compared to standard QEC methods.

We firstly discard the interior points and then sort the remaining vertices by x- / y- coordinates separately, and later create a group ofquadrilaterals (e-Quads) recursively according to the sequences ofthe sorted lists of points. Finally, the desired CH is built based on a simple polygon derived from all e-Quads. Besides the preprocessing for original planar point sets, this algorithm has another mechanism of discarding interior point when form e-Quads and assemble the simple polygon. Compared with three popular CH algorithms, the proposed algorithm can generate CHs faster thanthe three but has a penalty in space cost.},

   abstract = {We investigate quantum error correction using continuous parity measurements to correct bit-flip errors with the three-qubit code. Continuous monitoring of errors brings the benefit of a continuous stream of information, which facilitates passive error tracking in real time. It reduces overhead from the standard gate-based approach that periodically entangles and measures additional ancilla qubits. However, the noisy analog signals from continuous parity measurements mandate more complicated signal processing to interpret syndromes accurately. We analyze the performance of several practical filtering methods for continuous error correction and demonstrate that they are viable alternatives to the standard ancilla-based approach. As an optimal filter, we discuss an unnormalized (linear) Bayesian filter, with improved computational efficiency compared to the related Wonham filter introduced by Mabuchi [New J. Phys. 11, 105044 (2009)]. We compare this optimal continuous filter to two practical variations of the simplest periodic boxcar-averaging-and-thresholding filter, targeting real-time hardware implementations with low-latency circuitry. As variations, we introduce a non-Markovian “half-boxcar” filter and a Markovian filter with a second adjustable threshold; these filters eliminate the dominant source of error in the boxcar filter, and compare favorably to the optimal filter. For each filter, we derive analytic results for the decay in average fidelity and verify them with numerical simulations.},

   abstract = {Measurements of quantum systems inevitably involve disturbance in various forms. Within the limits imposed by quantum mechanics, there exists an ideal projective measurement that does not introduce a back action on the measured observable, known as a quantum non-demolition (QND) measurement 1,2. Here we demonstrate an all-electrical QND measurement of a single electron spin in a gate-defined quantum dot. We entangle the single spin with a two-electron, singlet-triplet ancilla qubit via the exchange interaction 3,4 and then read out the ancilla in a single shot. This procedure realizes a disturbance free projective measurement of the single spin at a rate two orders of magnitude faster than its relaxation. The QND nature of the measurement protocol 5,6 enables enhancement of the overall measurement fidelity by repeating the protocol. We demonstrate a monotonic increase of the fidelity over 100 repetitions against arbitrary input states. Our analysis based on statistical inference is tolerant to the presence of the relaxation and dephasing. We further exemplify the QND character of the measurement by observing spontaneous flips (quantum jumps) 7 of a single electron spin. Combined with the high-fidelity control of spin qubits 8-13 , these results will allow for various measurement-based quantum state manipulations including quantum error correction protocols 14. Spin-based qubits in semiconductor quantum dots 15 are a promising platform for universal quantum computing due to their high-fidelity coherent control, scalability and industry-compatible architecture. One of the current bottlenecks for the single-electron spin qubit is the fidelity and speed of its initialization and measurement. This limitation is due to the inherently destructive nature of the single-shot measurement method currently used 16. Quantum non-demolition (QND) measurements offer unique possibilities to overcome this issue using techniques such as repetitive readout 6 and feedback-controlled initialization 17. However, a QND measurement has remained elusive for electron spins, in contrast to other solid-state systems such as superconducting qubits 5 , or nuclear spins in diamond colour centres 18,19 and silicon donors 20. While particular types of photonic readout of electron spins 7,21,22 can, in principle, be QND, their QND nature has not been demonstrated so far. Moreover, QND measurement via an ancillary qubit is crucial 14 for measurement-based quantum algorithms including quantum error correction codes. We use a readout ancilla based on a singlet-triplet qubit 23 to demonstrate the QND measurement of a single electron spin in a GaAs/AlGaAs triple quantum dot (TQD) device (Fig. 1a,b). The single-spin eigenstates |↑〉 and |↓〉 of the electron in the left dot serve as a natural basis for the spin qubit. The Hamiltonian is written as = − E 2 z S Z using the Zeeman energy E Z and the Pauli operator z , with σ z = ±1 denoting its eigenvalue. The ancilla qubit is encoded in a two-dimensional space spanned by |↑↓〉 and |↓↑〉, where the first and second arrow denote the electron spin in the centre and right dots (both singly occupied), respectively. Using the pseudo-spin operators i A with i ∈ \{x, y, z\} for these two basis states, the corresponding Hamiltonian is = − + E J 2 2 z x A Z A A A , where ΔE Z and J A are the Zeeman field gradient and the exchange coupling , respectively, between the centre and right dots. The ancilla measurement is done by projecting it onto = = −− S () 1 2 or = = + + T () 1 2 (eigenstates of x A). In this hybrid system 3,4 , the energy splittings are gate-tunable due to the presence of the interaction term = − (1) J z z int 4 A (Fig. 1c). Namely, the inter-qubit exchange J is controlled through the wavefunction overlap between the left and centre dots. Viewed from the ancilla qubit, int changes the energy splitting of |↑↓〉 and |↓↑〉 by −Jσ z /2, making it dependent on the single-spin state. The dependence allows us to entangle the two qubits and extract information on the single spin via the readout of the ancilla in the following steps (Fig. 1d). Suppose that the single spin starts in an initial state |ψ〉 = α|↑〉 + β|↓〉, and is decoupled from the ancilla (J = 0). We first initialize the ancilla to its ground state |S〉 (an eigenstate of x A) by temporarily increasing J A. After that, we change the energy detunings between neighbouring dots to turn J A off and J on 4. Now that the ancilla eigenstates are |↑↓〉 and |↓↑〉 split by ΔE Z − Jσ z /2, the ancilla precesses in a plane of the Bloch sphere containing |S〉 and |T〉. After time τ, which we call the interaction time, the precession angle (or the relative phase of |↑↓〉 and |↓↑〉) becomes ϕ A − ϕ C σ z /2, where we define phases independent of and dependent on σ z , ϕ A = ΔE Z τ/ħ + ϕ 0 and ϕ C = Jτ/ħ, respectively (ϕ 0 is an offset due to the control pulse, as described in the Methods). The precession is terminated by a projective measurement of the ancilla onto the |S〉-|T〉 basis (spin blockade), giving an outcome M ∈ \{S, T\}. Figure 1e shows an example of the τ-dependence of the probability of finding a singlet P(M = S). It reflects the growth of phases ϕ A + ϕ C /2 for |ψ〉 = |↓〉 and ϕ A − ϕ C /2 for |↑〉, respectively. The ancilla measurement is most informative about the single-spin state if the two},

Fast high-fidelity readout enables midcircuit measurements, a necessary feature for many dynamic algorithms and quantum error correction, while a small footprint facilitates the design of scalable, highly connected architectures with the associated increase in computing performance. Here, we present two complementary demonstrations of fast high-fidelity single-shot readout of spins in silicon quantum dots using a compact, dispersive charge sensor: a radio-frequency single-electron box. The sensor, despite requiring fewer electrodes than conventional detectors, performs at the state of the art achieving spin readout fidelity of 99.2 in less than 6 μs fitted from a physical model. We demonstrate that low-loss high-impedance resonators, highly coupled to the sensing dot, in conjunction with Josephson parametric amplification are instrumental in achieving optimal performance. We quantify the benefit of Pauli spin blockade over spin-dependent tunneling to a reservoir, as the spin-to-charge conversion mechanism in these readout schemes. Our results place dispersive charge sensing at the forefront of readout methodologies for scalable semiconductor spin-based quantum processors.},

We theoretically investigate a Pauli spin blockade in a triple quantum dot molecule consisting of three identical quantum dots in a semiconductor in the presence of an external magnetic field through the molecule. When the three-electron state is on resonance with two- or four-electron states, the Aharonov-Bohm oscillation and the Zeeman splitting lead to a periodic spin blockade effect. We focus on the spin blockade at a two- and three-electron resonance and show that we can tune the magnetic field to selectively allow only either a spin-singlet or spin-triplet state to add an additional electron from tunnel-coupled leads. This spin blockade maintains the three quantum dots at the optimal sweet spot against the charge noise, demonstrating its potential as an efficient readout scheme for the qubits in quantum dot systems.},

Among the possible candidate platforms for realizing quantum computing devices, the compatibility with mature nanofabrication technologies of silicon-based spin qubits offers promise to overcome the challenges in scaling up device sizes from the prototypes of today to large-scale computers3–5. Recent advances in silicon-based qubits have enabled the implementations of high-quality one-qubit and two-qubit systems6–8. However, the demonstration of QEC, which requires three or more coupled qubits1, and involves a three-qubit gate9–11 or measurement-based feedback, remains an open challenge. Here we demonstrate a three-qubit phase-correcting code in silicon, in which an encoded three-qubit state is protected against any phase-flip error on one of the three qubits. The correction to this encoded state is performed by a three-qubit conditional rotation, which we implement by an efficient single-step resonantly driven iToffoli gate. As expected, the error correction mitigates the errors owing to one-qubit phase-flip, as well as the intrinsic dephasing mainly owing to quasi-static phase noise. These results show successful implementation of QEC and the potential of a silicon-based platform for large-scale quantum computing.},

Conventional computing methods are constrained in their accuracy due to the computational limits. The VQE may be used to model complex wavefunctions in polynomial time, making it one of the most promising near-term applications for quantum computing. Finding a path to navigate the relevant literature has rapidly become an overwhelming task, with many methods promising to improve different parts of the algorithm. Despite strong theoretical underpinnings suggesting excellent scaling of individual VQE components, studies have pointed out that their various pre-factors could be too large to reach a quantum computing advantage over conventional methods. This review aims to provide an overview of the progress that has been made on the different parts of the algorithm. All the different components of the algorithm are reviewed in detail including representation of Hamiltonians and wavefunctions on a quantum computer, the optimization process, the post-processing mitigation of errors, and best practices are suggested. We identify four main areas of future research:(1) optimal measurement schemes for reduction of circuit repetitions; (2) large scale parallelization across many quantum computers;(3) ways to overcome the potential appearance of vanishing gradients in the optimization process, and how the number of iterations required for the optimization scales with system size; (4) the extent to which VQE suffers for quantum noise, and whether this noise can be mitigated. The answers to these open research questions will determine the routes for the VQE to achieve quantum advantage as the quantum computing hardware scales up and as the noise levels are reduced.},

We realize CNOT gates via controlled-phase operations combined with single-qubit operations. Direct gate-voltage control provides single-qubit addressability, together with a switchable exchange interaction that is used in the two-qubit controlled-phase gate.

   abstract = {<p>Many important phenomena in quantum devices are dynamic, meaning that they cannot be studied using time-averaged measurements alone. Experiments that measure such transient effects are collectively known as fast readout. One of the most useful techniques in fast electrical readout is radio-frequency reflectometry, which can measure changes in impedance (both resistive and reactive) even when their duration is extremely short, down to a microsecond or less. Examples of reflectometry experiments, some of which have been realized and others so far only proposed, include projective measurements of qubits and Majorana devices for quantum computing, real-time measurements of mechanical motion, and detection of non-equilibrium temperature fluctuations. However, all of these experiments must overcome the central challenge of fast readout: the large mismatch between the typical impedance of quantum devices (set by the resistance quantum) and of transmission lines (set by the impedance of free space). Here, we review the physical principles of radio-frequency reflectometry and its close cousins, measurements of radio-frequency transmission and emission. We explain how to optimize the speed and sensitivity of a radio-frequency measurement and how to incorporate new tools, such as superconducting circuit elements and quantum-limited amplifiers into advanced radio-frequency experiments. Our aim is threefold: to introduce the readers to the technique, to review the advances to date, and to motivate new experiments in fast quantum device dynamics. Our intended audience includes experimentalists in the field of quantum electronics who want to implement radio-frequency experiments or improve them, together with physicists in related fields who want to understand how the most important radio-frequency measurements work.</p>},

   abstract = {Quantum error correction is of crucial importance for fault-tolerant quantum computers. As an essential step toward the implementation of quantum error-correcting codes, quantum nondemolition measurements are needed to efficiently detect the state of a logical qubit without destroying it. Here we implement quantum nondemolition measurements in a Si/SiGe two-qubit system, with one qubit serving as the logical qubit and the other serving as the ancilla. Making use of a two-qubit controlled-rotation gate, the state of the logical qubit is mapped onto the ancilla, followed by a destructive readout of the ancilla. Repeating this procedure enhances the logical readout fidelity from 75.5±0.3 to 94.5±0.2 after 15 ancilla readouts. In addition, we compare the conventional thresholding method with an improved signal processing method called soft decoding that makes use of analog information in the readout signal to better estimate the state of the logical qubit. We demonstrate that soft decoding leads to a significant reduction in the required number of repetitions when the readout errors become limited by Gaussian noise, for instance, in the case of readouts with a low signal-to-noise ratio. These results pave the way for the implementation of quantum error correction with spin qubits in silicon.},

   abstract = {A major signature of quantum mechanics beyond classical physics is coherence, the existence of superposition states. The recently developed resource theory of quantum coherence allows the formalization of incoherent operations-those operations which cannot create coherence. We identify the set of operations which additionally do not use coherence. These are such that coherence cannot be exploited by a classical observer, who measures incoherent properties of the system, to go beyond classical dynamics. We give a physical interpretation in terms of interferometry and prove a dilation theorem, showing how these operations can always be constructed by the system interacting, in an incoherent way, with an ancilla. Such a physical justification is not known for the incoherent operations; thus, our results lead to a physically well-motivated resource theory of coherence. Next, we investigate the implications for coherence in multipartite systems. We show that quantum correlations can be defined naturally with respect to a fixed basis, providing a link between coherence and quantum discord. We demonstrate the interplay between these two quantities in the operations that we study and suggest implications for the theory of quantum discord by relating these operations to those which cannot create discord.},

   abstract = {Full-scale quantum computers require the integration of millions of qubits, and the potential of using industrial semiconductor manufacturing to meet this need has driven the development of quantum computing in silicon quantum dots. However, fabrication has so far relied on electron-beam lithography and, with a few exceptions, conventional lift-off processes that suffer from low yield and poor uniformity. Here we report quantum dots that are hosted at a 28Si/28SiO2 interface and fabricated in a 300 mm semiconductor manufacturing facility using all-optical lithography and fully industrial processing. With this approach, we achieve nanoscale gate patterns with excellent yield. In the multi-electron regime, the quantum dots allow good tunnel barrier control—a crucial feature for fault-tolerant two-qubit gates. Single-spin qubit operation using magnetic resonance in the few-electron regime reveals relaxation times of over 1 s at 1 T and coherence times of over 3 ms.},
